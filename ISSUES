Something is broken with the way it's doing the IO of reading keys 
and encryption. Some content is causing gibberish on windows and the
symptom/behavior seems to vary depending on the host key content.

Need to rewrite this, but need to come up with a safe way to do it
that doesn't risk loss of credentials on the box.

Not entirely sure what the underlying issue is though as I only 
see it on windows and it seems to go away when I create a better
host key.
