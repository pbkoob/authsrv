Need:
-----
Ability to securely store password locally on machine

	
Approach:
---------
Encrypted result is stored in file whose name is stored in a directory structure of owner/userid/instance


Assumptions:
------------
Security: Access to host-key file is necessary to decrypt 



*** NOTICE *** Implementation for windows is barebones/minimal and effectively has
no security at this time. This implementation is purely for convenience of keeping the
code the same on unix and windows, and to keep passwords out of script source files.
